# GTA-Research

Research and writeups of the GTA V scripts.

## What is contained in this project?

This project contains all my (and possibly others) research into GTA V scripts. This project was made to mostly aid speedrunners playing on patch 1.27, however, any research is welcome; including multiplayer scripts.

## Where can I get the scripts?

For now, you can [download the 1.27 patch](https://www.speedrun.com/gtav/resources) if you don't already have it, and explore the update.rpf to export the scripts. Then use [zorg's script decompiler](https://github.com/zorg93/GTA-V-Script-Decompiler) to start reverse engineering.

As you go along, make documentation in any way you seem fit. Any documentation is better than none, so do it your way. The style can always be changed if and when it comes time to commit to this repository.

## My TODO

- Release 1.27 scripts for easy access.
- Release ImGTA for global script memory watcher.
- Release more research.
